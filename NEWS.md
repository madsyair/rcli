# rcli 0.1.1

* `cli_align()` brings daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly series to one
  frequency with rules set by the variable type (`series_types`: flow,
  stock, average). Weekly data are spread over days before they are summed
  into months. A quarterly reference series is disaggregated to months with
  the Denton-Cholette method (computed in the package, identical to
  'tempdisagg'), Chow-Lin (needs 'tempdisagg', now in Suggests) or linear
  interpolation; quarterly candidates are interpolated at the central month
  (last month for stocks), as the OECD does.
* `cli_candidates()` keeps the conversion record of `cli_align()` (new slot
  `alignment` of `CandidateSet`) and a `type` column in the metadata.
* `cli_quality()` adds an information row and a note when the reference
  series was disaggregated from quarterly data.
* `holiday_effect()` and `idulfitri_dates()`: moving-holiday regressors
  (such as Idulfitri) for X-13ARIMA-SEATS through
  `cli_spec(seasonal_adjust = TRUE, holidays = ...)`.
* The graphical interface records the variable type of each candidate in
  step 2 and in the exported script; the remaining English words in the
  Indonesian scorecard are translated.
* `CliSpec` prints the Granger criterion and the seasonal adjustment.
* The virtual classes `CycleFilter`, `Dater` and `Aggregator` are exported
  so that users can add their own methods.
* Objects saved with rcli 0.1.0 still work: the new slots are optional.

# rcli 0.1.0

* First release (developed under the working name 'leadcli').
* Quality scorecard `cli_quality()` with a good / acceptable / weak verdict
  from turning-point, prediction and out-of-sample criteria;
  `contraction_probability()` and `roc_curve()`.
* Step-by-step graphical interface `run_app()` (Indonesian or English) with
  plots for every step and export of results and a reproducible R script;
  `read_cli_data()` reads CSV files with a date column.
* Cycle filters: Hodrick-Prescott, OECD double Hodrick-Prescott,
  Christiano-Fitzgerald, Baxter-King and Hamilton; all replicate mFilter and
  neverhpfilter to machine precision.
* Turning points: Bry-Boschan (monthly) and Harding-Pagan BBQ (quarterly)
  censoring rules, checked against BCDating (golden file) and Coinprofile.
* Classification of candidates as leading, coincident, lagging or rejected
  from cross-correlation, turning-point leads, concordance and a Toda-Yamamoto
  Granger test, with default thresholds calibrated by Monte Carlo
  simulation.
* Aggregation with equal weights, principal components, Conference Board
  standardisation factors or a two-step dynamic factor model.
* Validation with turning-point statistics, quadratic probability score,
  area under the ROC curve and the Pesaran-Timmermann test; backward
  selection loop with an audit log; selection-bias harness for out-of-sample
  leads.
